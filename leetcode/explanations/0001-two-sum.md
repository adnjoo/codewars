solve twoSum in python

ChatGPT
The twoSum problem in Python involves finding two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target. Here's one way to solve it:

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # to store numbers we've seen so far along with their indices
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return None  # if no solution is found

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(twoSum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1] (because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9)
```

In this solution, we iterate through the array once. For each number, we calculate its complement (the number needed to reach the target). If the complement is already in the dictionary seen, we return the indices of the current number and its complement. If not, we add the current number to seen. If no solution is found, we return None.

explain how it works is it hash map

Yes, the solution I provided utilizes a hash map (implemented with a Python dictionary) to efficiently solve the twoSum problem. Here's how it works:

We initialize an empty dictionary called seen. This dictionary will store numbers we've seen so far along with their indices.

We iterate through the input array nums using enumerate() to keep track of both the index and the value of each element.

For each element num at index i in nums, we calculate its complement, which is target - num. The complement represents the number needed to reach the target.

We check if the complement exists in the seen dictionary. If it does, it means we have found the two numbers that add up to the target. We return the indices of the complement (stored in seen[complement]) and the current index i.

If the complement does not exist in seen, we add the current number num to the seen dictionary with its index i.

If we finish iterating through the array without finding a solution, we return None, indicating that no two numbers in the array add up to the target.

Using a hash map (dictionary) allows us to store numbers we've seen so far along with their indices. This enables constant-time lookup of whether a particular number's complement exists in the array, providing an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.
